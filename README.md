# Balatro CLI

A command-line clone of the popular deckbuilding roguelike game Balatro. This implementation focuses on the core poker hand evaluation and scoring mechanics with authentic Ante/Blind progression.

## About

Balatro CLI is a faithful recreation of Balatro's core progression system that runs in your terminal. Players must conquer 8 Antes, each containing 3 increasingly difficult Blinds: Small Blind, Big Blind, and Boss Blind. You're dealt 7 cards from a standard 52-card deck and can either play up to 5 cards to form a poker hand, or discard unwanted cards to get new ones. Each hand type has a base score and multiplier, and card values are added to create the final score.

## How to Run

```bash
# Build the game
go build -o balatro .

# Run the game
./balatro
```

Or run directly with Go:
```bash
go run .
```

For reproducible gameplay:
```bash
# Use a specific seed
go run . -seed 42
```

## How to Play

**üéØ CHALLENGE: Progress through 8 Antes, each with 3 Blinds!**

### Game Structure
- **8 Antes** total to complete the game
- Each Ante contains **3 Blinds** in sequence:
  - üî∏ **Small Blind** - Base difficulty
  - üî∂ **Big Blind** - 1.5x harder than Small Blind  
  - üíÄ **Boss Blind** - 2x harder than Small Blind (special rules coming soon!)

### Each Blind Challenge
1. You get **4 hands** and **3 discards** to reach the target score
2. You'll be dealt 7 cards from a shuffled deck
3. Choose your action:
   - **`play <cards>`**: Play 1-5 cards as a poker hand (uses one of your 4 hands)
   - **`discard <cards>`**: Discard unwanted cards and get new ones (uses one of your 3 discards)
   - **`resort`**: Toggle card sorting between rank and suit
4. The game evaluates your poker hand and adds to your total score
5. Beat the blind by reaching the target score before running out of hands
6. Complete all 3 blinds to advance to the next Ante
7. Type `quit` to exit early

### Example Gameplay
```
üî∏ Ante 1 - Small Blind
üéØ Target: 300 | Score: 0 [‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] (0.0%)
üé¥ Hands Left: 4 | üóëÔ∏è  Discards Left: 3

Your cards (sorted by rank):
1: A‚ô†
2: A‚ô¶  
3: K‚ô•
4: Q‚ô£
5: J‚ô†
6: 10‚ô¶
7: 9‚ô£

(p)lay <cards>, (d)iscard <cards>, (r)esort, or (q)uit: play 1 2 3

Your hand: A‚ô† A‚ô¶ K‚ô•
Hand type: Pair
Base Score: 10 | Card Values: 32 | Mult: 2x
Final Score: (10 + 32) √ó 2 = 84 points
üí∞ Total Score: 84/300

üî∏ Ante 1 - Small Blind
üéØ Target: 300 | Score: 84 [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] (28.0%)
üé¥ Hands Left: 3 | üóëÔ∏è  Discards Left: 3
```

## Blind Requirements

The difficulty scales progressively through each Ante:

| Ante | Small Blind | Big Blind | Boss Blind |
|------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 1    | 300         | 450       | 600        |
| 2    | 375         | 562       | 750        |
| 3    | 450         | 675       | 900        |
| 4    | 525         | 787       | 1050       |
| 5    | 600         | 900       | 1200       |
| 6    | 675         | 1012      | 1350       |
| 7    | 750         | 1125      | 1500       |
| 8    | 825         | 1237      | 1650       |

**Formula**: Base requirement increases by 75 points per Ante, with Big Blind = 1.5x Small Blind and Boss Blind = 2x Small Blind.

## Scoring System

The final score is calculated using the formula:
**Final Score = (Base Score + Card Values) √ó Multiplier**

### Card Values
- **Number cards (2-10)**: Face value
- **Face cards (J, Q, K)**: 10 points each
- **Aces**: 11 points each

### Hand Types

| Hand Type | Base Score | Multiplier | Example |
|-----------|------------|------------|---------|
| High Card | 5 | 1x | A‚ô† K‚ô¶ Q‚ô£ |
| Pair | 10 | 2x | 7‚ô• 7‚ô£ K‚ô† |
| Two Pair | 20 | 2x | 7‚ô• 7‚ô£ K‚ô† K‚ô¶ |
| Three of a Kind | 30 | 3x | 7‚ô• 7‚ô£ 7‚ô† K‚ô¶ |
| Straight | 30 | 4x | 5‚ô† 6‚ô¶ 7‚ô• 8‚ô£ 9‚ô† |
| Flush | 35 | 4x | 2‚ô• 7‚ô• 9‚ô• J‚ô• K‚ô• |
| Full House | 40 | 4x | 7‚ô• 7‚ô£ 7‚ô† K‚ô¶ K‚ô† |
| Four of a Kind | 60 | 7x | 7‚ô• 7‚ô£ 7‚ô† 7‚ô¶ K‚ô† |
| Straight Flush | 100 | 8x | 5‚ô• 6‚ô• 7‚ô• 8‚ô• 9‚ô• |
| Royal Flush | 100 | 8x | 10‚ô• J‚ô• Q‚ô• K‚ô• A‚ô• |

## Victory Celebrations

Each blind type has unique victory celebrations:

- **üî∏ Small Blind**: Sparkling celebration, advance to Big Blind
- **üî∂ Big Blind**: Lightning celebration, prepare for Boss Blind  
- **üíÄ Boss Blind**: Epic fireworks celebration, Ante conquered!

Complete all 8 Antes to achieve **ULTIMATE VICTORY** and become a true Balatro master!

## Strategic Considerations

### Early Antes (1-3)
- Focus on consistent scoring with pairs and two pairs
- Use discards to hunt for face cards and Aces
- Small Blinds are forgiving - don't waste high-value hands

### Mid Antes (4-6)  
- Start prioritizing higher-scoring hands (straights, flushes)
- Card value management becomes crucial
- Big Blinds require 800+ point hands

### Late Antes (7-8)
- Boss Blinds demand 1500+ points - you need premium hands
- Four of a Kind, Straight Flush, or Royal Flush may be necessary
- Resource management is critical - plan your 4 hands carefully

### General Tips
- **Resource Management**: You only get 4 hands and 3 discards per blind
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each Ante gets significantly harder
- **Discard Strategy**: Early discards to hunt for pairs/straights in easier blinds
- **Scoring Efficiency**: A pair of Aces (84 points) can beat low-card straights
- **Card Values**: Face cards and Aces significantly boost your totals
- **Boss Blind Prep**: Save your best hands for Boss Blinds when possible

## Testing

The game includes comprehensive tests covering the Ante/Blind system and poker evaluation.

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
go test

# Run tests with verbose output  
go test -v

# Run specific test suites
go test -v blind_test.go game.go deck.go hands.go
```

### Test Coverage

### Deterministic Testing
```bash
# Reproducible gameplay for testing

./demo_progression.sh
```

## Code Structure

The codebase is organized into focused, modular files:

- **`main.go`** - Entry point and command-line argument parsing
- **`deck.go`** - Card, Suit, Rank definitions and deck operations  
- **`hands.go`** - Interface-based poker hand evaluation system
- **`game.go`** - Ante/Blind progression, game loop, and player interaction

### Ante/Blind System

The progression system includes:

```go
type BlindType int
const (
    SmallBlind BlindType = iota
    BigBlind  
    BossBlind
)

// Calculates score requirements
func GetBlindRequirement(ante int, blindType BlindType) int

// Handles blind completion and advancement
func (g *Game) handleBlindCompletion()
```

### Interface-Based Hand System

Clean interface-based poker evaluation:

```go
type HandEvaluator interface {
    Name() string
    BaseScore() int  
    Multiplier() int
    Matches(cards []Card) bool
    Priority() int
}
```
