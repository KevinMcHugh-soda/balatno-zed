* cannot exit help modes with enter or escape
* money awarded on exiting shop
* sending a player event from a mode is really awkward - there should be a better way to do this
* mode state not preserved between actions, makes it impossible to build a confirm option
* can't purchase items from the shop in TUI mode
* can't reroll the shop in TUI mode
* TUI mode should maintain a trailing list of every event that occurs in the game and display it off to the right side of the screen
* files are messily-strewn about. We should have separate directories for game logic, UIs, tests, documentation.
* unit tests are almost non-existent. There's plenty of easy ones to write. Right now we're too dependent on manual testing.
